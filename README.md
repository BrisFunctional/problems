# BrisFunctional

This github is for collating everything we work on in BrisFunctional (Bristol's Functional Programming Club).

The next meeting will be April 19th 18:30 - 20:30 in Nokia's Wine Street office in Bristol.  See http://lanyrd.com/2011/brisfunctional-2/ for more details.  We will be looking at the first five problems from Project Euler (www.projecteuler.net)

See you there
